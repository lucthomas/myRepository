PROJECT TITLE: Code Task Hysopt

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To assess Java programming language knowledge.

VERSION or DATE: v0.1 04-02-2018

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 

Call for the Polynomial class. The inputs are: 
1. m: the highest possible exponent of the polynomial.
2. voa: an indicator determining whether the input is a polynomial or a derived polynomial.
	The polynomial indicator is 0, while de derived polynomial indicator is 1.

AUTHOR: Luc Thomas

USER INSTRUCTIONS:

The call to a polynomial will lead to CLI input requests to determine the coefficients of the polynomial.
Once the polynomial has been made, it is possible to derive the polynomial n times by means of the method derive(int n).
